# ValueStockScreener
Queries all stocks on both NASDAQ and NYSE and filters them based on certain financial metrics. The program will output two CSV files, one that contains the companies that meet the criteria and another that do not. I utilize the YahooQuery API to get the relevant financial metrics. 

### Requirements
* Pandas
* yahooquery

### Implementation
Simply run the fetching_data_nasdaq.py or the fetching_data_nyse.py file
